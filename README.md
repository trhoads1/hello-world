Personal Log.
It is December, the eighteenth, of the year two thousand seventeen, A.D.
My name is Taylor.
I currently work at a pool store in Frisco, Texas.
Before that, I worked as a pool guy for two years.
Before that, I worked as a glorified cashier in a grocery store.
Before that, I made sandwiches.
I graduated High School in 2009.
I hope to graduate with my associate's degree in 2018, and complete my bachelor's by 2021. 
I will be nearly 29 at that time. Wow!
I enjoy mathematics, having studied 400+ hours in the last 2-3 months in my free time. 
I enjoy programming with mathematics. I enjoy graphic and vector manipulation.
I enjoy writing api automation in windows.
Granted, there are children who can program and perform mathematics better than me, so I aim to further myself in these regards.


I enjoy writing! 
I enjoy reading!
I like textbooks and biographies more than recreational literature though. I used to like high fantasy and sci-fi books but I don't really have the patience for them anymore. I feel as if the characters are inconsistent, I get mad when I forget something or when two plot points seemingly don't meet or contradict because of some line I probably skimmed in the beginning. 
I used to really like Fiona Patton's series of high fantasy, but now I can't get through them for those reasons.
biographies, if I'm reading them, are usually treated with patience though. Because I'm reading about people that have influenced the world trillions of times over. Import is given to people of import. Import is not given to an imaginary character in a high fantasy book.

I didn't always think this way. I used to, as I said, enjoy high fantasy.
Maybe I'm just realizing that I'm getting old, and getting passionate about fake characters in my old books do nothing to absolve my ever lessening impact on the world.

The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is a biography of Richard Feignman is authored in major part by the man himself. One of the leading figures responsible for the successful development of the atomic bomb. Kept in this context, one can easily commit each page to memory. One can easily 'bother' to remember the important bits. Biographies are made much, much more interesting by being autobiographies. If I really believed that Richard really wrote every word, that would be an incredible read for me, even if the text didn't change.

Anyway, here's my first github commit. Neat.
